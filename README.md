**☕ Coffee Trend & Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)**

I built an interactive Coffee Trend and Sales Analysis Dashboard using Power BI to analyze sales performance, customer ordering behavior, and product popularity across different time periods. The dashboard is designed to help understand which coffee products sell the most, when customers place orders, and how sales trends change monthly and yearly.

The project includes two dedicated views:

Monthly Analysis to track day-wise orders, peak sales days, time-of-day demand, and weekday performance.

Yearly Analysis to compare overall sales, identify the best-performing months, and analyze long-term trends across different coffee types.

Users can interact with the dashboard using year and month slicers and visually select coffee types using image-based buttons, making the experience intuitive and user-friendly. Key business metrics such as total sales, total orders, average order value, peak day, and top-selling coffee are highlighted using KPI cards for quick insights.

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in data modeling, DAX calculations, interactive visual design, and storytelling with data. The dashboard demonstrates how raw sales data can be transformed into meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making in a real-world business scenario.
